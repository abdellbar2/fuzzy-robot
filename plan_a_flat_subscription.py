# A Product in Stripe represents a service you're selling â€“ in this case, a flat-rate streaming subscription
product_plan_a = stripe.Product.create(

    description="Unlimited monthly access to streaming service"  # Product description
)

# ================================

# Create a recurring monthly price of $24.99 for the product above
price_plan_a = stripe.Price.create(
    unit_amount=2499,                  # Price in cents ($24.99)

# 3. CREATE CUSTOMER
# ================================

# Create a test customer with a default payment method (Stripe test card)

# Notes:
# - Use `sk_test_...` API keys and `pm_card_visa` for testing only.
# - Do NOT use in production without securing keys, adding error handling, and validating inputs.
# - Consider listening to `invoice.payment_succeeded` webhook to handle post-payment actions.
